I am a (bio)statistician at Seattle Children's Research Institute.  I currently work on cystic fibrosis exclusively, with many of our group's projects being sponsored by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Prior to Seattle Children's I was at the University of Washington where I received a BS in math and and MS in biostatistics.
